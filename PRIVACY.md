# Birder's Privacy and Policy

This privacy policy describes how Birder (Acerbis Gianlyca) (“birder”, “us” or “we”) protects your (“you”, “the user”) privacy and your data. Before using our Alexa Skill (“our skill”), please read this policy, as well as the Alexa [Terms of Use](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201809740) and the [Privacy Policy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496) by the Amazon Digital Services LLC (with its affiliates, “Amazon”).

Regarding Amazon, “Alexa” means their Alexa Voice Service which includes third party services (like our skill) and other related Software.

If you use our skill you fully agree to this privacy policy.

## General
When you use our skill you have to talk to Alexa. This voice input is sent to Amazon and its transcription reaches us where we use it to understand what our skill should do for you (tweet text and other custom values). This is absolutely necessary for our service to give you an appropriate answer.

## Data
We never collect or share personal data with our skill. When you link your Twitter account, the access token needed to use Twitter APIs is stored by Amazon and provided every time you use our skill. We never use it without your authorization.

To improve our service we automatically analyze how often utterances are spoken and other analytics. This is done automatically by Amazon in the Amazon Developer Portal.

## Changes
Our skill or parts of it may change or be updated at any time. Further, this Privacy Policy might change. You can find a link to this policy on the description page of the skill in the Alexa App or in the Alexa Store. Your continued use of our skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or the skill itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.
